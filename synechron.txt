Converting from js to ts
Just create a .d.ts file and include it in the tsconfig.json's files array, so that it is always considered by the TypeScript compiler. In it declare those bits that TypeScript does not know about as type any. Once you've eliminated all errors you can gradually introduce typing to those parts according to your needs.
