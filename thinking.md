To extend base class n use it's methods in react .... Scenario is integrating material with react n extending idse library

Q. Copy render method n adopt to our template or render method
W. Base can have private method's how will u use that
E. Cannot change the base class implementation n declaration
R. Then how will you override  and use its private method's
T. Try interface is not a solution since we tell idse Lib to implement that
Y. Try super. Method . But it also didn't work
U. Copy those private functions and use in your class. It says error that same types declaration in both classes
I. Finally we need functionality only so why not copy functionality alone n put it in different method name


So you are integrating material Lib into idse to use its CSS classes

Q. When you gave correct template n css classes, still some conflict will be there between material n idse
W. So start integrating material in minimal application outside your existing project.
E. And try the same implementation
R. If that outside application works then you should start comparing existing with outside application
T. Now you can find a clue what went wrong
