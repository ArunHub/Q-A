Let -> let is a block scoping variable where we can able to reassign values.
Const -> unlike const we cannot reassign values again but can change property values inside obj without changing reference.
Array 



1.	Two es6 functions and es5 functions with console.log(this) console.log(arguments). What it prints
2.	If we bind one function with other and passing value and when we call the assigned variable with another variable what will happen
3.	When we return value from catch object and whether will next then object captures it
4.	Bind in arrow functions
5.	Function with object literal and its methods like increment and decrement and variable outside the object and returning that object. So when we call that object method to increment ++ and decrement ++ what it will print when obj.incr and obj.incr and obj.decr
6.	Bem and specificity, css selectors(think no one is using grid or flex)
7.	When we apply particular button extra class .. then whats the purpose of reusable of classes
