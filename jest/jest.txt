To run only one test with Jest, temporarily change that test command to a test.only inside a describe block in one file

writings testcase in [filename].test.js|jsx under __tests__ folder in root directory.
testcase can be nested according to actual file structure or **.test.js can be inside actual directory adjacent to each other.

press i for Interactive Snapshot Mode. Once you enter Interactive Snapshot Mode, Jest will step you through the failed snapshots one test at a time and give you the opportunity to review the failed output.
press u to update failed snapshots
You can even update the snapshots with --updateSnapshot or using the u key in --watch mode.

stopped at userouter query null error.
came to find out that jest is runner and enzyme/react testing library is assertion library. so mocking and rendering react components cannot be done by jest. react testing library is built top on testing library. jest is just testing javascript functions , mocks, after , before each and all.
jest is used to have limits but it used to run the test in a file.

testing library is for finding js dom in the document.

i tried mocking node modules and replicated as mentioned in jest and able to acheiving in userouter mock

now im not able to render resourcelist component. i have to try out beforeeach for axios call



const HelloWorld = () => <h1>Hello World</h1>
const {debug} = render(<HelloWorld />)
debug()

when i tried to debug above component. it shows the result as 
// <div>
//   <h1>Hello World</h1>
// </div>

but my component has polaris component so it has many lines.
const { debug, container } = render(
      <Base>
        <Addons data={props.data} />
      </Base>
    );
    const maxLengthToPrint = 10000;
    debug(container, maxLengthToPrint);

now i was able to get the result. and find out wondering why resourselist polaris component was not rendered.

testing playground extension addons useful in providing queries for testing .

when unmount applied , then window.scroll is not working throwing error.
after removing it, it worked.


when testing a particular testcase, use test.only and for nested describe, describe.only
or using npm scripts in package.json as jest [filename]

coverage for only these pages
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    "pages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",

  ],

when i was mocking axios calls for method get, post methods. i was able to do axios calls for both methods . even nested api calls methods of get and post . but when nested calls of two get methods, i was struck. so i tried many ways to solve this problem. finally i found that altering the order of axios calls solved the problem


jest -t "delivery capacity > city > index page"
